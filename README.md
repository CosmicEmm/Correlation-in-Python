# Happiness Score Correlation Analysis
This project analyzes the relationships between global happiness scores and various socioeconomic indicators such as GDP, average income, income inequality, and geographic region.

## 🚀 Features
Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and statistical correlation methods, this project explores:
- Which factors correlate most strongly with happiness
- Whether inequality reduces happiness
- How income and GDP relate to well-being
- Which features may be redundant or highly correlated

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
### Data Handling & Cleaning
- Selecting numeric and categorical features
- Converting categorical data into numeric codes for correlation analysis
- Handling formatting issues and type inference errors
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sorting and ranking correlations
- Filtering for strong positive and negative correlations
- Unstacking matrix for deeper analysis
### Visualization
- Scatter plots, regression plots, heatmaps
- Professionally styled charts (custom palettes, spines, grids, labels)
- Horizontal bar charts with:
    - Dynamic color-coding (positive/negative correlations)
    - Numerical annotations along bars
